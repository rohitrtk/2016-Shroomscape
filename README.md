|Grade 11| My final project for my Grade 11 Computer Science class. A 2D platformer that I made, I used other resources like youtube, more specific links in Summative.java, using said resources I understand how 2D platformers work. Use only for reference please.

Known Issues:
  - Problem with the yOffset, when the player lands from a high area, the yOffset becomes offset and makes the character higher than normal.
  - Problem with the player falling into the ground after jumping too high
  - Ladder only works if you start on the ground and hold up arrow when it should work if you hold up anywhere
  - Ladder starts to have a seizure when you go too high
  - You continue going up if you were on a ladder, holding up, you can fly off the ladder
